# THlossCompensation User Manual

**Overview:**
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for analyzing tail neuron hyperactivity patterns and refining motion registration in 2-photon imaging datasets. Core functionality revolves around processing calcium imaging data, tracking tail movement, and applying hierarchical classification logic.

**Requirements:**
MATLAB R2023b or later, Image Processing Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Suite2p/CaImAn for extraction of nuclear-labeled neurons.

### âš¡ GPU Acceleration

Several scripts in this repository support CUDA-based acceleration using MATLABâ€™s **Parallel Computing Toolbox**. To take advantage of GPU acceleration:

- Ensure a compatible **NVIDIA GPU** is available on your system.
- Install the latest **CUDA drivers** from NVIDIA and verify that MATLAB detects the GPU using `gpuDevice`.
- Scripts are designed to automatically detect GPU availability and offload computation where possible.
